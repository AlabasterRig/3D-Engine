# 3D Game Engine

This project is a simple 3D demo game engine developed in C++. It demonstrates basic rendering of 3D models in the OBJ file format and showcases fundamental transformations such as rotation and translation, using vector and matrix math for rendering in a console application.

## Features

- Rendering of 3D models in OBJ format.
- Basic transformations (rotation and translation).
- Camera controls using arrow keys.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio)
- `olcConsoleGameEngine.h` header file

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-demo-game-engine.git
   cd 3d-demo-game-engine

2. Ensure that the `olcConsoleGameEngine.h` file is included in your project directory.
3. Place your OBJ file in the project directory.

### Usage
This engine can be used as a base for developing 3D applications and games. Can extend it by adding more features such as lighting, textures, and advanced physics.
